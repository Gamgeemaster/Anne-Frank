            The play The Diary of Anne Frank, written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, tells the story of a young Jewish girl named Anne who hides with her family during World War II to escape the Nazis. In her diary, Anne shares her thoughts, dreams, and fears while living in a small secret space. The play shows her strong spirit and how she tries to stay hopeful even when times are tough. This story is still important today, especially when we think about what people in Ukraine are going through because of the ongoing war there. I made a 3d model, because it is relevant to today due to how many ukrainians are losing their homes to russian missiles and bombs. The goal of my model and report is to highlight how Anne Frank's story is a famous example of a situation that many people have and are going through.
            One big theme in Anne’s diary is the loss of innocence. As a young girl, Anne wanted to live a happy life, go to school, and play with her friends. But the war forced her into hiding, where she had to face a lot of fear and danger. Many children in Ukraine today feel the same way. Because of the war, they are being taken away from their homes, friends, and the normal lives they once had. Just like Anne had to grow up fast, these kids are also dealing with tough situations that change their childhood forever.<br><br>
            Another important theme in Anne's story is hope during hard times. Even though she was living in a scary situation, Anne always believed things could get better. She dreamed of being a writer and stayed positive. Today, people in Ukraine show a similar kind of hope. Even with everything going wrong around them, many Ukrainians try to stay strong and support each other. They hold onto their dreams and believe that peace will come back. Anne’s hope reminds us that the human spirit can stay strong, even when times are really tough.<br><br>
            In my own production I am focusing on the theme of isolation. Anne Frank was isolated from the rest of the world from 1942-1944. During the years Anne’s family and the Vann Danns were isolated in a small attic in amsterdam. Many families in Ukraine are being trapped and isolated due to the bombings and destruction of buildings and houses.<br><br>
            In my model I chose to model a small apartment, due to how Russia is targeting high population places in Ukraine like apartment buildings, and hospitals.<br><br>
            In conclusion,  Anne Frank and the Ukrainian and Russian war are related through their themes of isolation and the loss of innocence and war.<br><br>
